<h1>Hi, I'm Samuel.</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify">
I am passionate about engineering, technology and entrepreneurship.

Currently, I am working as a signal analyst, in the Digital Electronic Warfare research group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), on exciting problems in Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Cape Town.

I am interested in research and development (R&D) work in Embedded Systems, Artificial Intelligence, RF engineering and Sensor and Data Fusion.

See my <a href="{{ '/assets/Samuel_Mbiya_CV.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">CV</a> for more information.

In my spare time, I also enjoy <a href="https://unsplash.com/@samuelmbiyaphotography">photography</a> and working on <a href="https://github.com/samuelmbiya/">personal software/hardware projects</a>.
