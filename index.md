<h1>Hi, I'm Samuel.</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify">
I am passionate about engineering, research and entrepreneurship.

Currently, I am working as a signal analyst, in the Digital Electronic Warfare research group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), on exciting problems in Electronic Support Measures (ESM) and Electronic Intelligence (ELINT).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Cape Town.

I am interested in research and development (R&D) work in Embedded Systems, Artificial Intelligence, RF engineering and Sensor and Data Fusion.
