<h1>Hi, I'm Samuel.</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify">
I am passionate about engineering, research, entrepreneurship and using my skills to solve challenges faced locally, on the African continent, and internationally. 

 Currently, I am working as a graduate engineer, in the Digital Electronic Warfare research group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), on interesting problems in Electronic Support Measures. I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Cape Town.

I am interested in research and development (R&D) work in S(cience), T(echnolgy), E(ngineering) and M(athematics), specifically in the fields of Embedded Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Digital Signal Processing, Biomedical Engineering and Radar engineering.

I am curious, creative, self-motivated, a fast learner and a hard worker. I am always looking to learn new skills, gain knowledge and collaborate with others.
