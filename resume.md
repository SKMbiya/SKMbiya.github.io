### EXPERIENCE

**Graduate Engineer** | *Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)* <span style="float: right; ">Nov 2022 - Present</span>  
Working on Electronic Warfare Support Measures (ESM) research and development in the Digital Electronic Warfare Research Group at the CSIR.

**Tutor** | *University of Cape Town* <span style="float: right; ">Feb 2022 - Jun 2022</span>  
During the 2022 1st semester, I was a tutor for the Electrical Engineering Design Priciples course (EEE3088F) presented to 3rd year electrical engineering students. The role involved marking tests, weekly assignments and project submissions. My responsibilities also involved mentoring 4 teams of students throughout their course project, which involved designing and fabricating an environment sensing expansion board (HAT) for the STM32 microcontroller discovery board. The teams made use of tools such as KiCAD for circuit board prototyping and Git/Github for collaboration and version control, and fabricated their boards using the services of JLCPCB.
 
**Vacation Work Student** | *Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)* <span style="float: right; ">Nov 2021 - Feb 2022</span>  
I worked once again in the Digital Electronic Warfare Research Group within the Defense and Security cluster at the CSIR. The project that I worked on involved benchmarking the performance of deep learning models for signal classification, using libraries such as Tensorflow and Pytorch (Python), and MLJFlux and Flux (Julia). I was exposed to concepts in Machine Learning and Radar and made use of Python and the Julia programming language.
