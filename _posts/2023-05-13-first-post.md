It's been almost 5 months since my personal website has been live. The goal of this website is to have a small corner the internet where I can provide my professional profile, work experience and share my personal projects and ideas. A big reason I also wanted to have the website was to practice my writing skills through the use of a blog. Writing (and good communication in general) is a skill that I am always looking to improve, both verbally and in written form. So, after putting it on hold, I finally got the courage to post my first blog post - 5 months later. My hope is that this blog will kickstart a solid writing habit.

I've thought about some ideas for the content of my blog posts, but at this stage I'll probably document and share progress of my personal projects, rough notes on new concepts that I've come across or that I am learning - this will be more of a reference for me that I can refer back to as work on different projects. I've also taken an interest in photography as a new hobby - maybe I'll share some of my work as well. Watch this space. However, the goal that I have set for myself is to write and post something every weekend and to incorporate any interesting quotes, links, videos or anything I've come across during the week. 

I'll leave you with an interesting quote from W. Dale Blair's lecture titled: "Engineering in the Real World" as part of the [IEEE Aerospace & Electronic Systems Society](https://ieee-aess.org/educational-activities/distinguished-lecturers/virtual-distinguished-lecturer-library)'s (AESS) Distinguished Lecturer webinar series:

> Engineers solve problems. Good engineers solve problems that only a few people can solve. Great engineers solve problems that almost no one else can solve.

Check out the full lecture [here](https://ieee-aess.org/presentation/engineering-real-world). Dale gives a wonderful introduction to Target Tracking during the lecture, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and many other golden nuggets of advice for engineers early in their careers.

Until next time.
